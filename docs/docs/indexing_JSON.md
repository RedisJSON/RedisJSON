description: Combine Redis JSON and Search and Query to index and search JSON documents
---

In addition to storing JSON documents, you can also index them using the [Search and Query](/docs/stack/search) feature. This enables full-text search capabilities and document retrieval based on their content.

To use these features, you must install two modules: JSON and Search and Query. [Redis Stack](/docs/stack) automatically includes both modules.

See the [tutorial](/docs/stack/search/indexing_json) to learn how to use Search and Query with JSON.
