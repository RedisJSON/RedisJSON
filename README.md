## Overview

RedisJSON is a [Redis](https://redis.io/) module that implements [ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard](https://json.org/) as a native data type. It allows storing, updating, and fetching JSON values from Redis keys (documents).

## Primary features

* Full support of the JSON standard
* [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) syntax for selecting elements inside documents
* Documents are stored as binary data in a tree structure, allowing fast access to sub-elements
* Typed atomic operations for all JSON value types
* Secondary index support when combined with [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/)
